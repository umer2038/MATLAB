Metaheuristic Optimization of Human Pose Populations for Enhanced Pose Estimation
Advanced AI Project | 2025
Team Size: 3 | Role: Optimization Engineer & Pose Analysis Lead

In this project, we tackled the challenge of enhancing human pose estimation accuracy by refining initial pose predictions using advanced metaheuristic optimization algorithms. Leveraging real motion capture datasets (GTpose.mat and PopulationPoses.mat), we applied four powerful algorithms — Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) — to minimize the deviation between candidate poses and ground truth data.

We carefully designed a fitness function using pose-specific metrics like Mean Joint Position Error (MJPE), Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), and Pose Estimation Accuracy (PEA) to guide the optimization process. For each algorithm, we created a tailored methodology and executed a full evaluation pipeline measuring both quantitative and qualitative performance across pose refinements.

This project provided deep insights into the strengths and trade-offs of nature-inspired algorithms in a real-world AI application — aligning computer vision with optimization for high-fidelity pose correction.
